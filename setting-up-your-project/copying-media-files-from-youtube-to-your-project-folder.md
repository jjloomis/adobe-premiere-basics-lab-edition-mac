# Downloading media files from YouTube to your project folder

* Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and find the video you want to add to your project. Copy the URL.
* Go to [Cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/). Paste the URL of the YouTube video in the empty field. Leave the **Auto** button enabled to download the full video (video and audio) or click the **Audio** button to download the audio component of the video. Click the **double arrow** button to download the file.&#x20;
* Click the **Save** button in the **Save As** box. The file will download to your **Downloads** folder.
* In your **Downloads** folder, rename the file (follow [JAMS file and folder naming conventions](https://jjloomis.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management-mac-os-edition/file-and-folder-naming-conventions).)
* Move the file to your project folder. You may need to [open multiple Finder windows](https://jjloomis.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management-mac-os-edition/opening-multiple-finder-windows) to do this.
